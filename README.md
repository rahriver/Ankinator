# Ankinator
A Python script that you can run on your text files to extract new words from it and create anki flashcards out of them.

## Usage
- Run the `File_Cleaner` script on your text to make it clean and by making it clean I mean to remove any dots and numbers and junks from the text file to make words more accessible.
- Then you can change the `Metadata` inside the python script for your own use and run the script.
